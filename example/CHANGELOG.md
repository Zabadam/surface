## [0.0.2+2] - 23 FEB 21

* Added a state boolean and Timer in initState to give [surfaceAsAppBar] a gradient flip effect, showing off intrinsic animation
* Added an onTap: () => setState((){}) to [surfaceAsPopup] for quick demonstration of random color animation
* Added some more comments
* Gave clearer names to the example state-controlling booleans
