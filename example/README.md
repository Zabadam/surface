# Surface Example

Example usage of the [Surface](https://github.com/Zabadam/surface) package for Flutter. See [Surface Example Android source](https://github.com/Zabadam/surface/example/lib/main.dart): `/example/lib/main.dart` and [Surface Example APK](https://github.com/Zabadam/surface/example/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk).

## TODO:

- Intrinsic animations of [Surface.corners] property change.
    - Currently there is a conditional swap where any Surface build method utilizes the Beveled Shape to a RoundedRect Shape.
    - Ideally, I believe, there would be a `Decoration.lerp()` involved.
    - This "aggravates" the simplicity of [Surface] to develop, but would provide a better end-user result: more accurate and performant animations that are just as easy to use. (Almost effortless? ðŸ˜‰)

- Differed radius on [innerSurface] when using [SurfaceCorners.ROUND] vs [borderContainer]
    - Smaller inner radius gives a better aesthetic for nested rounded rectangles
