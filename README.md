### WIP
# 'Surface' Flutter Package

[Surface](https://github.com/Zabadam/surface) is an AnimatedContainer and Material with a number of convenience parameters and customization options, through standard approaches and bespoke shape-crafting.

 * Work in progress transfer from an [Android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zaba.bug_bash 'Bug Bash in the Play Store') on which I am primarily focused.

* A shapeable, layered, intrinsincally animated container Widget that supports blurring ImageFilters, Material InkResponse, and HapticFeedback; and way more.

* The package currently includes a couple goodies that I use in my project. I would like to incorporate these extra features more tightly with Surface.

* Color extensions `Color.withBlack(int subtract)` and `Color.withWhite(int add)` may be handy at least.

* A modified `SplashFactory` called `CustomInk` is present in goodies.dart as well.

* This is my first public package and I expect things may still be altered greatly.
